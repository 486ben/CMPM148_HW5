Game Playable link:

Rule: 
<li>I have a time represented in the system. </li>
<li>Resetting time must be marked within the game itself and responded to with narrative options. Previous loops must be remembered not only by the player, but also their character and new choices have to be expressed. This can be expressed with a hidden or visible "topic" inventory.</li>
<li>Loops should last less than five minutes and aim for a play time of more than 10 minutes</li>
